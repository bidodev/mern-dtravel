# [Dtravel]()


# Find the vacation of your dreams with Dtravel!

 A platform that helps you find a special vacation in line with your taste.
 Check the filters to sort our destinations according to your wish, whether it is a tropical, snowy, hiking, cycling trip, or just a city tour. Created with the MERN stack and Redux.

## General Info

This project is not intended for production. 
The reason I built it was to practice building web applications from scratch and get familiarized with the use of Redux and Firebase.
